# Exercises

1. What is your own background with computers? Interpret this question as broadly as you'd like. 
2. Take a few minutes and take seriously the following question: how do you read? What happens during the process? Describe it in 3-5 sentences.
3. What kinds of technologies do you use for reading? Do you feel that your use of different technologies and different ways of reading \(reading a physical books versus reading something on your computer versus reading it on an ereader\) changes your experience of reading? 
4. How do you imagine that reading was different in the nineteenth-century than it is today?
5. Use the Google NGram Viewer to track two different terms that interest you. Interpret the results. What seems interesting? What kind of historical events can you imagine might have taken place to account for shifts that you see? What terms rise or fall and when? Feel free to do brief searching on Wikipedia or Google to back up your interpretations, but don't overdo it. Keep things to 3 sentences each. Provide a screenshot for the NGram search you carried out.
