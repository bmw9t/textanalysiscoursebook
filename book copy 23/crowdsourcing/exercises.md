# Exercises 
Design a Prism game and answer the following questions. 

1. What text will you mark?
2. What about this text are you interested in exploring? What is the interpretive intervention that you hope to make?
3. Who will you address it to? Why this particular group?
4. After designing your *Prism* get at least five people to read and mark the text for you.
5. What do you notice about the results? Anything interesting in the visualizations? The way people were interpreting the markings? The groups?
6. What limitations do you see with *Prism*? Can you imagine other ways of examining individual interpretations in the context of the group?
