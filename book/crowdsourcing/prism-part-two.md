title:  Prism Part Two

Think back to *[Prism](/book/prism.scholarslab.org)* and the transparency game. So far we have only really focused on the single transparencies, the individual interpretations supplied by each person. But the crucial last element of the game involves collecting the transparencies and stacking them. Hold the stack up the light, and you get a whole rainbow. *Prism*'s visualizations offer one way of adapting this activity to a digital environment.

In this photo from the "Future Directions" page for *Prism*, you can see the prototype for another possible visualization that would shuffle through the various sets of highlights. Even without this animated interpretation, *Prism* allows you to get a sense of how a whole group interprets a text. When you upload your own markings, they become collected along with those of everyone who has ever read that text in *Prism*. We can begin to get some sense of trends in the ways that the group reads.

*Prism* was designed as a middle road between the two types of crowdsourcing projects that we discussed in the last section. By asking users to mark for a restricted number of categories, it can quantify those readings and visualize them in interesting ways. But it also asks for readers to actually read the text - interpreting a document along certain guidelines still asks readers to exercise the full range of their powers as thinking people. For this reason, the [designers of *Prism* see it as **crowdsourcing interpretation**](/book/http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/07/08/llc.fqu030.full?keytype=ref&ijkey=4zaX5fIvQwiLhIJ).

*Prism* offers a few options to facilitate group reading. Most importantly, it assumes very little about how its users will use the tool. Anyone can upload their own text as a *Prism* and, within certain guidelines, adapt the tool to their own purposes. When logged in, you can create a *Prism* by clicking the big create button to pull up the uploading interface:

When uploading a text, you will paste your text into the window provided. *Prism* does not play with super long texts, so you may have to play around in order to find a length that works for the tool as well as for you. The three facets on the right correspond to the three marking categories according to which you want users to highlight. The rest of these categories should be self-explanatory. Note, however, that you will only be able to give a short description to readers: your document and marking categories will largely have to stand on their own.

Below these main parameters for your text, you will be asked to make some other choices that may be less intuitive: 
![listed vs unlisted prism interface](/assets/crowdsourcing/prism-create-two.jpg)

By default, *Prism* assumes that the text you will upload and all its markings will be made available to the public. Selecting **unlisted** will make your *Prism* private so that it will be viewable only to people to whom you send the URL. Once you create the *Prism*, you will want to be extra certain that you copy that URL down somewhere so that you can send it out to your group.

*Prism* will also ask you what license you want to attribute to your materials. Many of the choices offered here are [creative commons](/book/https://creativecommons.org/) licenses, but you can also choose public domain or fair use depending on your use case. If you are unsure, you can always select no license, but it would be worth doing a little research about the materials you are uploading to find out their legal status.

Once you upload a text, the easiest way to find it will be to go your personal page by clicking the "MYPRISMS" link from the top menu. In this profile page, you can easily access both those texts that you have uploaded as well as the ones that you have highlighted by others (quite handy if you lose the URL for an unlisted text).

With these tools, you can upload a range of texts for any kind of experiment. It is tempting to say that you are limited by your imagination, but you will run up against scenarios in which the parameters for the tool cause you headaches. That's OK! Take these opportunities to reflect:

> What will the tool not let you do?
> 
> Can you imagine good reasons for these limitations?
> 
> How would you design a different tool?

As you work through *Prism*, think critically about the kinds of things that it claims. 

> Do you feel that this sort of work is fundamentally more empowering than the kind we saw with *Typewright*, *Recaptcha*, and *Transcribe Bentham*?

 > Are there other, better ways of facilitating group collaboration, digital or otherwise?
