title:  Topic Modeling Case Study
---
In the previous section, we described how a single text could be broken up into a list of words and their frequencies, and we also suggested a single text might be composed of any number of discourses or topics. To infer the underlying topics, we can use **topic modeling**, a computational method that allows you to discover the topics that construct a text. Topic modeling does so by exercising a variety of statistical protocols over and over again. Executing topic modeling projects yourself takes more hands-on programming than we want to introduce in this coursebook. So instead of exercising the techniques themselves or offering a tool for doing so, we are going to attempt to describe what topic modeling is and how to interpret results from it using a case study. Come talk to either of us in person if you want to go further and explore topic modeling on your own.

We will do a lot of statistical handwaving in what follows, but we have some extra resources at the bottom of the page if you are interested in learning more about the mechanics of how topic modeling works. In the "Bags of Words" article, we walked through a paragraph and suggested that by skimming it you can infer the types of topics that a paragraph deals with. Topic modeling works in a similar way: the software looks for words that tend to occur next to each in statistically significant ways. As humans, though, we have an upper limit to how much we can hold in our head to compare to each other: a few topics, a few texts. A computer doesn't have that same problem. Topic modeling software can process hundreds of thousands of texts. Over and over again, refining its sense of how all the pieces fit together.

So when you run topic modeling software, it looks for words that occur near each other in texts in meaningful ways over the course of the corpus. In most cases, it looks for words that occur in documents together. Remember, these words are not dependent on their location _within_ the document. Topic modeling iworks on a bag of words model that only cares about whether or not the words occur within the text itself, not their position within the text. But you might occassionally **chunk** larger documents into a series of paragraphs so that the software thinks about them each as separate documents for finer granularity.

After running over the whole corpus, the results of topic modeling will give you a series of results files. The first, a topic\/term matrix, will contain lines that look something like this:

```

```

The program spits a series of "topics," which in this case is defined as a set of words that tend to occur in documents together with statistical significance. In these examples, we asked for the program to give us twenty topics; this is the first number on the left-hand side. Note two things: the first is that the numbers start with 0 and end with 19, instead of starting with 1 and ending with 20. The second is that I have selected a few topics to highlight out of the total number; not all twenty are listed here. After the numbers, you see the series of words that make up that topic. The computer does not know anything about these topics at all; it merely sees that these words often co-occur in the document. 

The real work of topic modeling involves interpreting these topics in ways to make them meaningful to readers. Some of them are noise, artifacts of words that tend to occur next to each other. But others make more sense. Based on topics 1 and 5 you might be able to infer that these particular texts came from sound recordings of some kind. Topic 2 might suggest that we are talking about reading texts. Much of the work of topic modeling involves trying to make assumptions about what kinds of discourses are implied by these clusters of words. In this case, the corpus under question is about 1.8 million forum posts from [librivox.org/https:/www.librivox.org), a site that produces public domain audiobooks.

```

So looking at these topics, we might see that a number of them deal with aspects of sound recording. The texts often tend to talk about the act of producing these recordings. Topics 15 and 17 are also notable, as they represent French and German language topics. In any large corpus that is primarily one language, texts written in other languages will tend to group together. If we assumed before that medical language would tend to occur next to each other, this makes sense. French vocabulary is far more likely to appear next to other French vocabulary, in a text that is entirely French.

Information like this can be very useful, because topic modeling also spits out, for each document in the corpus, a matrix showing what percentage each topic is likely to contribute to that text. It might contain hundreds of thousands of segments that look something like this \(modified slightly for readability\):

The first line here contains information about the document, an ID for the document and then a name for it. In this case, each forum post has its own URL, so we are using the URL for the ID.

```

```

What follows is a list of each topic produced by our topic modeling software and the weight of each topic for that document:

```
12 0.14788732394366197
1 0.13380281690140844
11 0.07746478873239436
17 0.035211267605633804
15 0.035211267605633804

```

So topics 12, 1, and 11, in that order, are the three most prominent topics in the document. Topic 12 has a weight of 14% in the document, and so on. Using this information, if we know the dates that each text was published, we can actually determine the rise and fall in prominence of different topics over time. Remember topics 15 and 17, our German and French language topics? They aren't especially prominent in this first text \(an English one\). But we can get a sense of where French and German texts are likely to occur by charting the ebb and flow of this topic over time:

![topic modeling french and german topics over time](/assets/topic-modeling/topic-modeling-french-german.jpg)

We get clear spikes in the German topic from September to December 2014, and slightly smaller peaks in the French topic in late 2007 and 2008. Since we know that these topics represent pretty coherent approximations of the use of French and German language in the corpus, we can use techniques like these to argue that these particular moments represent periods of heightened activity by the French and German communities of LibriVox users. Based on this evidence, we could make arguments about the global interconnectedness of the community of LibriVox users. We might then take this information back to the corpus and ask new questions based on this data.

> What kinds of books are important to these communities?
> 
> What kinds of conversations are they having?
> 
> Why do these languages spike at these particular times?

Until now, we have stressed approaching text analysis with a clear sense of your interests and the research questions that drive them. Topic modeling works a little differently: it is more useful for exploratory work. We call topic modeling **unsupervised classification** because we are asking the computer to analyze and mark a text without giving it any clear directions. We just say, "here is some text. Do your thing and tell me what you find." A **supervised classifier** would take information from us to help it make decisions. We might say, "read this text. If it has more than fifty uses of the word 'crime' mark it as 'detective fiction.' If it has fifty uses of the word 'sex,' mark it as 'romance' \(more on supervised classifieres in the next chapter\). Unsupervised classifiers like topic modeling instead know very little about the underlying texts that they are examining. Instead, they process them based on an underlying model.

In the last lesson we called the **bag of words** model an epistemology of texts, a way of understanding texts that might be different from what you were familiar with. In the case of the kind of topic modeling we have been discussing, that model could further be called **Latent Dirichlet Allocation \(LDA\)**. We won't go into too much detail about the specifics of LDA, but it is important to know that this is the model you are working with. LDA is a model that assumes that there are a text is constructed from a small number of topics.

Don't be alarmed if topic modeling probably seems much more abstract than the material we have covered until now. To really understand how topic modeling works under the hood, you will need to have a grasp of a variety of different topics in machine learning and statistics. We are not so concerned that you understand these specifics. We care, instead, that you understand the idea behind it, have some sense of how to read make sense of other topic modeling projects, and be able to explain them to others in general terms.

* Andrew Goldstone and Ted Underwood have a great case study of [topic modeling /https:/andrewgoldstone.com/blog/2012/12/13/pmla/)[_PMLA_/https:/andrewgoldstone.com/blog/2012/12/13/pmla/) that also includes lots of useful introductions to topic modeling.

* The Programming Historian has a [good introduction/http:/programminghistorian.org/lessons/topic-modeling-and-mallet) for executing topic modeling yourself using Mallet. Will get technical, but the early surveys of what TM is can be very helpful.
