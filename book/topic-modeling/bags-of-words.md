title:  Bags of Words
---
When we read, our eyes move in sequence across the page and take in phrase after phrase in the order in which they were intended. This sense of chronology is integral to how we, as human readers, understand texts. But it is possible to imagine other ways of reading. Have you ever skimmed over a page backwards looking at every other word? You probably still got the gist of the text even though you didn't read it in order and even though you missed many of the words.

Take this passage:

> I will, for the sake of argument, assume that the information given to the coroner by the officer of one of the medical schools is correct, and that Dr. Phillips is right in considering that the character of the mutilation in question justifies the assumption that the perpetrator was probably one who possessed some knowledge of anatomy. But that the inference which has been deduced is warranted, any one who is the least acquainted with medical science and practice will unhesitatingly deny and indignantly repudiate. That a lunatic may have desired to obtain possession of certain organs for some insane purpose is very possible, and the theory of the murdering fiend being a madman only derives confirmation from the information obtained by the coroner. But that the parts of the body carried off were wanted for any quasi scientific publication, or any other more or less legitimate purpose, no one having any knowledge of medical science will for a moment believe.

The excerpt is from a letter about the Jack the Ripper murders from the _Pall Mall Gazette_ published on September 28, 1888. Even without knowing anything about the context, you can probably infer rough senses of the topic of the text: murder. We might further say that there are a number of overlapping topics in the text: evidence, medicine, murder, and many more. But how did you know this? Besides reading the whole text, you could probably skim and get a sense from certain words that strongly indicate these topics to you. Here is the same passage with one representation of how reading might have taken place for you using [_Prism_/https:/prism.scholarslab.org). We have highlighted various words associated with particular categories as such:

```
Highlight Color: Topic
---
red: evidence
green: medicine
blue: murder
black: words where two or more topics were marked the same amount.
grey: no topic marked
```

In this example, each of these colors represents a different kind of topic that the text is dealing with: a language associated with proving things, one connected to medicine and one about crime. But you could also think that other newspaper articles about Jack the Ripper might feature a different set of topics. Probably most deal with crime, but you might have read texts that focus on the victims or on the police investigation into the murders. Alternately, certain words might be really good indicators that a particular topic was being discussed, whereas others are more loosely related to the topic. For instance, although the word 'practice' might appear in such a conversation, a word like 'anatomy' is more closely indicative of the topic of medicine. So each text is made up of some mix of topics like these, and you could distinguish between texts by finding out what topics they discuss and to what degree they discuss them. Wouldn't it be interesting if we could somehow see the whole web of topics that occur in a text? And to think about how different topics appear in different texts?

One problem with using \_Prism \_to do this work is that it depends on someone setting up these categories beforehand, and thus in essence knowing \(or guessing\) something about the text before we started the process of text analysis. But maybe there are some "hidden" topics in the text that we don't even know to look for. So what if we could use computers not just to distinguish between texts based the topics they discuss, but also to find the very topics themselves?

We are beginning to float a different kind of reading. Let's take one more step back.

If we take the words in a text as being indicative of its underlying topics, we actually don't need to worry about word order so much. We just care about whether the words are there or not, not the order they come in. Our previous examples have preserved the sense of narrative time in a text - when we counted words with _Voyant_, we then graphed them over time. But we can find out interesting things about texts if we are a little more flexible if we think about them not as things that unfold over time but rather as pure token counts, as **bags of words**. In a bag of words model, word order becomes irrelevant. All we care about is what words occur in a text and how often they do so. Pretty straight forward, right?

Take the following two sentences:

"Fine. How are you doing?"
"How are you doing? Fine?"

If we _normalize_ a text by removing the stopwords, lowercasing the words and getting rid of the punctuation, we get a bag of words. In this case, the bag of words for these two sentences is the same: 

```
[
    "fine", 
    "how", 
    "are", 
    "you", 
    "doing"
]
```

Not only would be want to know what words are being used, we'd also want to know how often they are mentioned. So a bag of words model for the following two sentences might produce something like the following:

Sentence 1: "Barbara is doing fine, thank you."
Sentence 2: "Thank you, Dave. I am doing fine."

```
Words in Corpus
[
    "Barbara",
    "is",
    "doing",
    "fine",
    "thank",
    "you",
    "Dave,
    "I",
    "am"
]

Counts for Sentence 1
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
Counts for Sentence 2
[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```

Here we get two lists. "Words in Corpus" gives all of the words in our documents. "Counts for Sentence 1" and "Counts for Sentence 2" detail the number of times each of those terms occur in each sentence. So the first element of the Counts list for Sentence 1 is 1, because "Barbara" occurs 1 time. Sentence 2 has 0 in that same position because the word "Barbara" does not occur in the sentence. We could have numbers as large as we need in order to represent the text as a whole. Pretty easy for a couple short sentences, but imagine being able to break apart whole texts like this.

You might feel like this goes against everything that you've ever known about reading. This might feel like destroying a text. You're not wrong. This concept is pretty far removed from how we tend to read, since we tend to read in sequence across the page. This approach, instead, wants you to think about reading in a different way, to develop a new epistemology for the process. We lose something in the process, the sense of a text as it unfolds over time.

But we also gain the ability to think about a text in new ways. If we have lists of words for each text as well as for the corpus \(or set of documents\) as a whole, we can actually work backwards towards those topics we were talking about a moment ago. Instead of skimming a paragraph to determine its basic topic, we could scan full texts -- and scan lots of them \(Brandon's record is about 1.8 million texts in a corpus\). And rather than trying to get a sense of 1-3 topics, we could break our text apart into 15-20 different topics. Now we are cooking with gas, and we're talking about topic modeling.
