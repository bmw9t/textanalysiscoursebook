title:  Supervised Classifiers
---
In the lesson on topic modeling, we talked about unsupervised classifiers. We explored about topic modeling could explore texts to find the underlying discourses at work within them. But our input data, our texts, were not really labeled in any way. We did not say, "topic modeler, go out and search for a topic called, 'medicine.' It looks like this. let me know what you find!" Instead, we trusted the topic modeling software to produce a whole bunch of series of words. 

You could maybe think of unclassified classifiers as a kind of roomba. You hit a button, and the tiny little robot dutifully goes out and starts cleaning your floor. It knows when it reaches walls and corners that it should try to scoot around them. And its cleaning brushes are spinning furiously the whole time. You haven't told the machine how to clean, or how to navigate your floor. You just push the button and trust that it has inherent assumptions and protocols that it will follow. That covers the unsupervised part, but an unsupervised *classifier* is obviously more sophisticated and different. Instead of cleaning your floor, topic modeling uses statistics to sort the words in your texts in such a way that you can get a sense of underlying patterns in word usage. 

Let's try another example. Imagine you have a bag with apples, oranges, and bananas in it. Imagine you also don't have any idea what an apple, an orange, or a banana is. Now I tell you to sort the things in the bag. You can still sort them, and you would do so by creating three piles. You take the first item, and place it into a pile on its own. Pull out a second item. Does it look similar to the first? No? Gets a new pile. Third item? Looks like the first one, so it goes next to that one. Each time you pull a new item, you compare it to all the others and revise your piles accordingly. At the end, you'll have three different piles, organized by fruit. But you didn't know anything about those fruits ahead of time.

Now imagine, instead, that I give you a slightly different exercise. I give you a bag filled with dragon fruit, star fruit, and durian. Imagine that you don't know anything about these fruit. I say, "find me all the durian." If you don't know anything about durian, you won't be able to do so. So first I bring in ten examples of durian for you to study. I say, "Look at them. Study them. Pay attention to these characteristics: they have spikes, they are big, and they are yellow-ish." I might also give you several examples of non-durian fruit so that you can get a sense of what durian don't look like. This set of fruit, where I tell you the correct labels for the fruit, is called our **training set**. Now, you pull a fruit. No spikes. So you start a pile called not durian. The next one has spikes. Durian! You keep going until you have two piles, ones that you think are durian and ones that are not. 

This kind of classification is called **supervised classification**. You had to be taught what the durian looked like before you could really do anything. We would call these a feature set, and it might look something like this:

```
feature_set = {
'has_spikes': True,
'size': 'big',
'color': 'yellow-ish'
}
```

Don't worry too much about the brackets, equals sign, etc. These are just a common way of organizing the information so that the computer can read them. Using this feature set, we reasonably guessed whether or not it was a durian. Notice how you could only work in binaries: the fruit was either a durian or not. Your not-durian pile had star fruit and dragon fruit in it, since you weren't really able to distinguish between the two in this thought experiment. We could only answer something like the following if we looked at star fruit: 

```
fruit.is_durian?
>>> False
```

Or this if we were looking at a star fruit.
```
fruit.is_durian?
>>> True
```
So the test is actually pretty simple in its results, even if the feature set that leads to them is more nuanced. True and False are referred to as **boolean data types** in programming, and these boolean values are used to test or represent whether something is just that - true or false. 

So we have been developing a series of tests for fruit types, but you might not have been perfectly correct: after all, durian are not the only fruit that are large spikey and yellow-ish. A kiwano melon could have gotten thrown into the mix, and you might have incorrectly identified it as a durian. Or you might have gotten an unripe (green) durian, which you incorrectly tossed in the wrong pile. So we could better characterize our two piles as "probably not durian" and "probably durian." The use of the word "probably" should be a clue here - we have drifted into probability and statistics. Don't worry too much about that for now, but you should know that what we have developed here is a very basic **naive Bayes classifier**. Thomas Bayes was an eighteenth-century statistician, and this classifier relies on his underlying [theory of statistics/https:/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics). There are other types of classifiers, but this kind assumes that each feature in our feature set will have some say in determining whether or not the unknown fruit is a durian. The classifier combines these likelihoods with the total number of times that durian actually occurred in our example set of fruit to determine the probability of each label. In this case, our labels are durian or not-durian, true or false, though you could have more than just two labels. The classifier then picks the label with the highest likelihood.

We have trained ourselves to classify fruit, and we could replicate that same process on durian at a later date. If a master fruit vendor comes along, he could probably tell us how accurate we were. We could then compare our accuracy to another person trained to classify fruit, and we could figure out who is the better classifier.

This might all seem a bit removed from the kinds of work that we have been doing elsewhere in the book, but we wanted you to get a firm foundation in what classification is before we modeled an example relative to text analysis.
