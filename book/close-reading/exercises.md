Questions 3-5 ask you to work with our class Prism, available from [here](/book/INSERT URL HERE). INSERT URL HERE. Highlight the Prism according to the rules of the game first before responding to the following questions.

* I want you to spend some time reading a short passage and then describing the process in as great detail as you can manage. What kinds of things do you notice about the passage? Are you looking for particular things? What goes through your head? Then read the passage two more times and repeat the same exercise, describing in detail what goes through your head. Your passage to work from: 

> The public calls the hero wicked, and the wicked a hero; it also calls the virtuous a harlot and a harlot virtuous. . . . So were the Countess Du Barry and Marie Antoinette. Through her dissolute and revolting debauchery, Du Barry amazed the universe in the alleys, and the crossroads of Paris. She did all these things in evil ways. The same debauchery and agitation of passions were observed in Marie Antoinette's life. Men, women, everything was as she liked. She was satisfied with everything. Her clumsiness as well as her careless mistakes involuntarily gave her behavior the publicity du Barry sought. These two famous women were much alike when it came to misleading and degrading the one they owed respect to. Until his death, du Barry fooled Louis XV. She would sleep with any valet as well as with courtiers. Marie Antoinette also was unfaithful to Louis XVI and fooled him too....
> 
> The Duke of Choiseul, who was considered to be as good as Richelieu and Mazarin, was a sort of Prime Minister. Louis XV was the weakest of men and the most despicable prince of his century. This Duke, who was as scheming as he was bold, had paid for his favor through submission, a servile obedience, and the accomplishment of the most awful political crime one could ever imagine. Even though he had power, he was afraid of du Barry's intrigues. He despised her and even insulted her in public.
> 
> The Du Barry organized a conspiracy. Her side was powerful. The Duke had enemies. He had made some reforms and he had been in office for a long timeâ€”at court, people like to see change. Finally he was afraid of a coming fall. It was natural he was looking for a protection. He thought he had found one by organizing the marriage of the pretty archduchess and the Dauphin.,,. this marriage made the Duke become odious to the eyes of the nation.

* What does the previous exercise make you notice about reading in general? About your own reading process?

* How did you read differently when using _Prism_? Can you imagine other variations of the tool? How might things with five interpretive categories, for example?

* Say something interesting about the results that _Prism_ gives you. What new interpretations does it give you about the text?

* Think more critically about the categories I have chosen for you to highlight. What assumptions do you think I have about them? How does putting them against each other in this way make you think about them differently?
